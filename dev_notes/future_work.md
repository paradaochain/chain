# Future Work

### DAO Roles

Currenty there are only 3 types of roles,
ideally roles should be created when creating the DAO.
Each role should map to specific permission(s) applicable.
These permissions should also be flexible and members can vote to change them.

### Proposal

Proposal should have different expiration, threshold

### Voting

Staked tokens should contribute to the voter's weight,
there should be a snapshot for the weight of the votes at time of proposal
