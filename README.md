# ParaDAO

para d√£o - to give in Portuguese
ParaDAO provides tools for communities with the same passion / shared interests to come together to organise amongst themselves to acheive a common goal.
The decentralised application that allows communities to create a DAO easily with out of the box options for managing:

-   Governance process
-   Roles
-   Opiinion polling

## Special features

### Support by staking

In addition to direct donation , ParaDAO has a native currency that is minted according to a [bonding curve] where the rewards can be distributed to the staker or the DAO treasury.

[bonding curve]:

### Community types

ParaDAO initially has composable options that are designed to support 2 types of DAOs

#### 1. Individual support

Inspired by Patreon / Substack,
individuals who produces valuable contents may be supported by a community / fan base through a DAO.

In this case,
the DAO roles will only be the admin (content producer) and the supporters,
where the supporters can participate in some polls / suggestion and the admin will have full control over the DAO treasury.

#### 2. Interest Groups

Inspired by meetup.com,
a group of individuals may want to contribute to say a software code base, a meetup events etc.
Some members of the DAO should be rewarded for their contributions,
and some other members may just be users of a software or participants of an event.

In this case,
the DAO will have a selection of roles of which the users in each role may be able to vote / execute subset of actions only.
It is also likely in this case that the treasury is managed by proposals and votes.

### Prediction Market

It is a problem with the lack of participation in voting in DAO governance models.
ParaDAO leverages prediction markets to encourage participation in different forms.

For example,
early voters for a [binary prediction market] will have little certainty of the outcome and therefore if the vote automatically provide a position in a prediction market,
early voters will be rewarded more than the late voters, when the outcome is more predictable.

## Components

-   A parachain node with Pallets specifically to allow for DAO creation
-   A relay chain node to simulate staking of relay chain native tokens
-   Frontend allow users to create DAOs easily, allow DAO members to do proposals, votes, etc
-   integration with Zeigeist sdk

## Hack

### Docker

```sh
# Run network
docker-compose --file docker-compose-xc.yml up

# Stop and clear
docker-compose --file docker-compose-xc.yml down -v && ./scripts/clear-all.sh
```

_Note: This may take a few minutes for Parachain to start producing blocks as it gets registered_

The relavant ports are:

-   Paradao ws: 9944
-   Paradao rpc: 9933
-   Relay ws: 6644

You can then deploy contracts at https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/contracts
The package is contract_name.contract

#### Contracts

-   Go to `contracts/factory` and do `./build-all.sh`
-   Head to UI to first _upload_ dao wasm - `target/ink/dao/dao.wasm`.
-   Once the upload tx has been included in the block, obtain the code hash in the `Event` (under
-   Network: Chain Info) in the UI.
-   _upload and intantiate_ the factory contract - `target/ink/factory/factory.contract`, use the param
    0 and the previous dao contract code hash (`ty` will change the structure of daos)

### Local build collator

Requirements:

-   Node
-   Docker
-   Rust
-   jq
-   curl

#### 1. Build the collator for the parachain

```sh
# root dir
cargo build --release
```

#### 2. Run the relay chain

```sh
docker-compose --file docker-compose-xc.yml up
```

#### 3. Register and start parachain collator

_Note: Ensure that step 2 nodes are producing blocks_

```sh
	./scripts/local-run-para.sh
```

#### 4. Tear down

```sh
docker-compose --file docker-compose-xc.yml down -v && ./scripts/clear_all.sh
```
